========

Please note a recent reversion in the release format.  To accommodate incremental upgrades for players with weak Internet connections, binary-only and media-only ZIPs that are not intended to be playable out of the box are being provided for the unstable releases starting with 2018-04-04.

Starting with August 18 2018, there are three such archives: binary-only, sound-only, and media-no-sound.

First installs on a machine should use a complete ZIP archive.  FOr incremental upgrades, the binary archive is always required.  The media archives are needed if and only if they exist.
