1, Command Line Options
=======================
Sorry, there is no --help or /?.  C# actively disables C stdout 
for graphical programs.

--city=[city size],[district size]
Overrides the world generation options for city size and district size.  The default values of these options correspond to
--city=5,50

If either number does not parse, the whole option is dropped.

--spawn=...
Overrides the new game dialog data entry.

The first character is the game type:
C: Classic
I: Infection
V: Vintage
Z: Classic w/corpses [VAPORWARE, not actually implemented yet]

The second character is the race
L: Living
Z: zombie/undead

The third character is the type.  For livings we have
M: male
F: female
For undead, the above specify zombiefied versions.  Additional options for undead are
s: Skeleton
S: Shambler
Z: Zombie master

For livings, the starting skill is requested as a string representation of the Skills.IDs enumeration, starting at the fourth character.

--no-spawn

This will be ignored without --PC to nominate an NPC for player control.  The usual player character will not be created.

Use of a game with a known seed and the --socrates-daimon option is highly recommended, to get the name of an appropriately interesting NPC.

--PC "name"

This option influences loading the game.  "name", is the name of an NPC to be converted into a PC.

It may also be used to control additional PCs at game start (police and civilians, for now); best results in conjunction with --seed.

--seed=[int]

This option only influences New Game.  If provided, the master RNG seed, 
from which the game maps are built, is set from this option.  The default 
is to set the master RNG seed from the system time.  The seed reported by
City Info, will replicate the map when entered with this option.

The master RNG seed *is* part of the savegame.  It is used to re-initialize 
the RNG when L)oading the game.
  
In theory the C# Random class can be saved and loaded, but the consequences 
of the underlying language library locks failing are awesome.  Once corrupted 
by use from two distinct threads at once, the return value becomes 
the constant zero.  So there are good technical reasons to permit the 
limited RNG adjustment by savescumming there is.

--socrates-daimon

This option only influences New Game.  If provided, cheat commands useful in 
simulating an unusually effective divine interest in the PC are provided.

  CTRL-[City Info] (default CTRL-I): updates Config/daimon_map.html .  Open in a web browser 
    to get the wisdom you asked for.

--subway-cop

This option only influences New Game.  If provided, and the game happens to 
have a subway entrance in the starting district, the guaranteed subway cop
is also a PC.

In general, scoring doesn't work right in multiple-PC games.


2. Joining the thin blue line
=====================
As befits a zombie apocalypse, the police are not getting proper backup 
from outside.  They are finding out about the arrival of reinforcements,
from the reinforcements.  An enterprising civilian or survivor can *become* 
a cop by disguising him/herself as one and acting the part.  (The disguise
would be exposed and charges filed once the outbreak was contained, but 
this is an apocalypse.)
1) Obtain a police radio and turn it on.  CHAR technology is the new standard 
   in police radios; their crystal radio-like efficiency allows the solenoid 
   magnets to recharge the radio with each step taken.  They should never 
   run out of power in normal use.
2) Obtain at least one of a light pistol, or a shotgun.  Multiple ranged 
   weapons do not disqualify, but only these allow bluffing being a cop.
3) Wear at least one of a police padded jacket or police riot armor.
4) Do not be a hoplophobe (Firearms 1+) and have a commanding presence 
   (Leadership 1+).
5) Do not commit any murders.

Immediately after the daily skill gain check, a civilian or survivor 
fulfilling the above requirements at the time will be asked if they want 
to become a cop.  This is (currently) an irreversible decision.  

The Prisoner Who Should Not Be will not talk to a cop.  (Note: that script 
has not been counter-adjusted in detail.)


N. Recovering from crash reports in the simulation thread
=========================================================
If the last few lines of the crash report look like

   at djack.RogueSurvivor.Engine.RogueGame.SimulateDistrict(District d)
   at djack.RogueSurvivor.Engine.RogueGame.SimulateNearbyDistricts(District d)
   at djack.RogueSurvivor.Engine.RogueGame.SimThreadProc()

Then the crash was in the simulation thread.  If there should be any 
unexpected side effects, Task Manager should be used to
completely shut down Rogue Survivor Revived from the process view.

The problem image name is RogueSurvivor.vshost.exe with description vshost.exe .

N+1 I get this crash ... 
========================
System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: '!!0[] System.Array.Empty()'.

Rogue Survivor Revived was dynamically linked against a .NET lower than 4.6 .  For Windows systems, 
install 4.6.x by direct download from Microsoft.  Initially reported against 0.9.7 at 
http://smf.cataclysmdda.com/index.php?topic=12463.15 , but this is current for all versions
requiring .NET 4.6 .
